## Bank Management System
This is just a prototype system with some functionalities that a bank application should consist of.
It uses basic CRUD Operations in order to store/retrive data.

This Application is completly made using Swing Library and AWT components. This isn't just any Java Swing Application, it totally and completely build up from scratch without using any GUI builder.

This is a graded Mini Project of Java for my 4th Semester @ AURO University, Surat.
